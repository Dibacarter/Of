AFTER THE INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS, ANY REMAINING DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY, OR CLAIM (COLLECTIVELY, “CLAIM”) RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE PARKWOOD’S SERVICES AND/OR PRODUCTS, AND ANY USE OR ACCESS OR LACK OF ACCESS THERETO, WILL BE RESOLVED BY ARBITRATION, INCLUDING THRESHOLD QUESTIONS OF ARBITRABILITY OF THE CLAIM. YOU AND PARKWOOD AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM WILL BE SETTLED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, USING THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, ADMINISTERED BY JAMS UNDER ITS COMPREHENSIVE ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES (THE “JAMS RULES”) THEN IN EFFECT (THOSE RULES ARE DEEMED TO BE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS SECTION, AND AS OF THE DATE OF THESE TERMS). BECAUSE YOUR CONTRACT WITH THE PARKWOOD, THESE COMBINED TERMS, AND THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE CONCERN INTERSTATE COMMERCE, THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT (“FAA”) GOVERNS THE ARBITRABILITY OF ALL DISPUTES. HOWEVER, THE ARBITRATOR WILL APPLY APPLICABLE SUBSTANTIVE LAW CONSISTENT WITH THE FAA AND THE APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS OR CONDITION PRECEDENT TO SUIT. ARBITRATION WILL BE HANDLED BY A SOLE ARBITRATOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE JAMS RULES. JUDGMENT ON THE ARBITRATION AWARD MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY COURT THAT HAS JURISDICTION. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE COMBINED TERMS WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS – CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE COMBINED TERMS, YOU AND PARKWOOD ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS ARBITRATION.
(C) EXCEPTIONS. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU AND PARKWOOD AGREE THAT THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED IN A COURT OF PROPER JURISDICTION:
(I) DISPUTES OR CLAIMS WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF A SMALL CLAIMS COURT CONSISTENT WITH THE JURISDICTIONAL AND DOLLAR LIMITS THAT MAY APPLY, AS LONG AS IT IS BROUGHT AND MAINTAINED AS AN INDIVIDUAL DISPUTE AND NOT AS A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION OR PROCEEDING;
(II) DISPUTES OR CLAIMS WHERE THE SOLE FORM OF RELIEF SOUGHT IS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF (INCLUDING PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF); OR
(III) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DISPUTES.
(D) COSTS OF ARBITRATION. PAYMENT OF ALL FILING, ADMINISTRATION, AND ARBITRATOR COSTS AND EXPENSES WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE JAMS RULES, EXCEPT THAT IF YOU DEMONSTRATE THAT ANY SUCH COSTS AND EXPENSES OWED BY YOU UNDER THOSE RULES WOULD BE PROHIBITIVELY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN A COURT PROCEEDING, PARKWOOD WILL PAY THE AMOUNT OF ANY SUCH COSTS AND EXPENSES THAT THE ARBITRATOR DETERMINES ARE NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE ARBITRATION FROM BEING PROHIBITIVELY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN A COURT PROCEEDING (SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE REIMBURSEMENT AS SET FORTH BELOW).
FEES AND COSTS MAY BE AWARDED AS PROVIDED PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW. IF THE ARBITRATOR FINDS THAT EITHER THE SUBSTANCE OF YOUR CLAIM OR THE RELIEF SOUGHT IN THE DEMAND IS FRIVOLOUS OR BROUGHT FOR AN IMPROPER PURPOSE (AS MEASURED BY THE STANDARDS SET FORTH IN FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 11(B)), THEN THE PAYMENT OF ALL FEES WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE JAMS RULES. IN THAT CASE, YOU AGREE TO REIMBURSE PARKWOOD FOR ALL MONIES PREVIOUSLY DISBURSED BY IT THAT ARE OTHERWISE YOUR OBLIGATION TO PAY UNDER THE APPLICABLE RULES. IF YOU PREVAIL IN THE ARBITRATION AND ARE AWARDED AN AMOUNT THAT IS LESS THAN THE LAST WRITTEN SETTLEMENT AMOUNT OFFERED BY PARKWOOD BEFORE THE ARBITRATOR WAS APPOINTED, PARKWOOD WILL PAY YOU THE AMOUNT IT OFFERED IN SETTLEMENT. THE ARBITRATOR MAY MAKE RULINGS AND RESOLVE DISPUTES AS TO THE PAYMENT AND REIMBURSEMENT OF FEES OR EXPENSES AT ANY TIME DURING THE PROCEEDING AND UPON REQUEST FROM EITHER PARTY MADE WITHIN FOURTEEN (14) DAYS OF THE ARBITRATOR’S RULING ON THE MERITS

THE NOTICE MUST BE SENT TO PARKWOOD WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF YOUR FIRST REGISTERING TO USE THE SERVICES OR AGREEING TO THESE COMBINED TERMS; OTHERWISE YOU SHALL BE BOUND TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES ON A NON-CLASS BASIS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE TERMS. IF YOU OPT OUT OF ONLY THE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS, AND NOT ALSO THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER, THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER STILL APPLIES. YOU MAY NOT OPT OUT OF ONLY THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND NOT ALSO THE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS. IF YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS, PARKWOOD ALSO WILL NOT BE BOUND BY THEM.
(F) WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BRING CLASS ACTION AND REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND PARKWOOD EACH AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDING TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM, OR CONTROVERSY WILL BE BROUGHT AND CONDUCTED ONLY IN THE RESPECTIVE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS PART OF ANY CLASS (OR PURPORTED CLASS), CONSOLIDATED, MULTIPLE-PLAINTIFF, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING (“CLASS ACTION”). YOU AND PARKWOOD AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS ACTION. YOU AND PARKWOOD EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A CLASS ACTION IN ANY FORUM. IF THE DISPUTE IS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION, THE ARBITRATOR WILL NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO COMBINE OR AGGREGATE CLAIMS, CONDUCT A CLASS ACTION, OR MAKE AN AWARD TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION. FURTHER, YOU AND PARKWOOD AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS FOR MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND IT MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CLASS ACTION. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, HOWEVER, YOU CAN SEEK PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF TO THE EXTENT AUTHORIZED BY LAW AND CONSISTENT WITH THE EXCEPTIONS CLAUSE ABOVE.
IF THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS LIMITED, VOIDED, OR FOUND UNENFORCEABLE, THEN, UNLESS THE PARTIES MUTUALLY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE PARTIES’ AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE NULL AND VOID WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PROCEEDING SO LONG AS THE PROCEEDING IS PERMITTED TO PROCEED AS A CLASS ACTION. IF A COURT DECIDES THAT THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SECTION ARE DEEMED INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE, ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION MUST BE BROUGHT IN A COURT OF PROPER JURISDICTION AND NOT IN ARBITRATION.
